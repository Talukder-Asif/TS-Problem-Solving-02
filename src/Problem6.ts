// You are given an object representing a book with properties title (string), author (string), and publishedYear (number). Use type alias for declaring the object. Write a TypeScript function called isRecentBook that takes this book object as input and determines if the book was published in the last 5 years. 

// Hints: Use getFullYear() method to extract the year to check the given year with current year.

type Book = {
  title: string;
  author: string;
  publishedYear: number;
};
function isRecentBook(book: Book): boolean {
    const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
    return currentYear - book.publishedYear <= 5;
}

// Example usage:

const book1: Book = {
  title: "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  author: "Harper Lee",
  publishedYear: 2020,
};

console.log(isRecentBook(book1));
